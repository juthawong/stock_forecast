##MATH 191 project: forecast stock return using option data

#### Abstract
Stock option can be a crucial indicator for the movement of the underlying stock. We propose a method that uses historical stock returns, percentage changes of the option Greeks, and option returns to forecast future stock returns. One major diﬃculty of forecasting using options is the lack of feasible ways to construct consistent time series from option data. This diﬃculty stems from the fact that for each stock, the options have distinct strike prices and maturities from day to day. In this project we developed an algorithm to construct the time series by picking the options whose strike price is the closest to the stock price, and using linear interpolation to approximate the changes of option and its Greeks on particular days. After constructing the time series, we feed them into a number of predicative models and use portfolio Sharpe ratio in excess of market to measure the model performance. The method is tested on the option data of six large US companies, and it turns out that Support Vector Machines yields the best predictions. Finally, we apply the Recursive Feature Elimination algorithm to analyze the top predictors of the SVM model, which reveals the percentage change in option Gammas to be the most important predictors.
